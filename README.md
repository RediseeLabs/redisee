# RediSee - An Easy-To-Use Redis Visualizer for Developers

RediSee is a light-weight web application that visualize Redis instancesâ€™ core metrics in a user-friendly manner. Our open-source tool is available for free and allows developers to easily monitor essential metrics such as memory usage, keyspace cache/hit ratio, evicted keys, as well as latency and throughput data.

## How To Use

RediSee is a web application that you can either run locally or deploy on a server for continuous and remote monitoring.

```

```

OR 

```
npm run dev
```

- After the webpage has loaded, click on either the "+" or "connect" button and fill in the name of your Redis instance, port, and host. You will notice your Redis instance added on the sidebar as soon as the form has been submitted.
